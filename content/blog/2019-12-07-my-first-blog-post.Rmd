## Excited to be here!

I'm Rob, and as an environmental scientist and aspiring marine biologist, coding and understanding how to work with large datasets is important to me and for my future career. Through the course of my undergraduate career at the University of Texas, I've had a wonderful amount of exposure to various statistics classes, coding classes, among others, and these classes have given me the groundwork for being knowledgeable in modeling, bioinformatics, and data wrangling. 

In the short time of the course of a semester, we've worked mostly with RStudio in SDS 348 (Computational Bio and Bioinformatics), but towards the end, we've moved to Python. With Python, we've been introduced to the basics, regular expressions, for-loops, some algorithms (e.g. Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm), among other things.
```{python}
import pandas
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
```
Using `seaborn` in python, one can pull datasets such as tips and create a complete description of what the data in the  set look like:
```{python}
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
tips.describe()
```
Here, I pulled up the `tips` dataset that has data points on the tips and total bills of dining experiences, as well as the gender of the person paying for the party. The average tip per gender of the tipper can be calculated like this: 
```{python}
#using pandas groupby functionality
groups = tips.groupby('sex')
groups['tip'].mean()
```
Even though these are incredibly simple uses of Python functionalities, they are important tools to have for large datasets, and more complicated functions can be built off of these!

###Regular Expressions

Now, this is where things become more complicated! A fantastic tool to have in one's arsenal is regular expressions, or Regex. By taking a string of _whatever you want_, one can use regex to pull out specific pieces. For example, when given a string of urls with other extraneous pieces of code, regex can be used to pull out and return only a list of the wanted urls:
```{python}
import re

Whew, if you made it through that massive chunk, congrats! For an example of what regex can do, that string is a bit excessive, but I wanted to give an example of how useful it can be for something as long as that. As a biologist, the following string and regex function are super useful to me:

```{python}

re.findall(r"A[ACGT]TAAT|GC[AG][AT]TG",string7)
```
As you can tell, the regex deployed here is sort of a fancy command F (Find) where it searches for variations of the specific sequences in a DNA strand that one is searching for--here it is restriction enzyme binding sites `ANTAAT` and `GCRWTG` (Note that per the IUPAC nucleotide code, N is any base, R is A or G, W is A or T).

To wrap up, the computational biology and bioinformatics course here at UT (SDS 348) has been a wonderful experience, and learning how to work with both R and Python for modeling (check out my modeling project 2!), loops, regex, algorithms, etc. has been phenomenal. Thanks Nathaniel!
